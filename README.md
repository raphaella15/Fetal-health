This project focuses on predicting the health status of fetuses using machine learning techniques. 
The goal is to develop models that can accurately classify fetal health based on various parameters measured during cardiotocography (CTG) exams. 
Predicting fetal health can aid healthcare professionals in making timely interventions to prevent adverse outcomes during pregnancy and childbirth.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features extracted from CTG exams,
including fetal heart rate (FHR), uterine contractions (UC), and fetal movement (FM), among others. 
The target variable is the fetal health status, categorized into three classes: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological.
